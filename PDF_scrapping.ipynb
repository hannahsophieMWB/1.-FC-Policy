What is appropriate will depend on the nature, size and complexity of the firm’s business, as  well as the risk to which the firm is exposed. Firms should adjust the intensity and frequency  of monitoring in line with the risk-based approach. Firms should in any case determine.  a)  Which transactions they will monitor in real time, and which transactions they  will monitor ex-post. As part of this, firms should determine:  i.  which high-risk factors, or combination of high-risk factors, will  always trigger real-time monitoring; and   55   ']\n",
